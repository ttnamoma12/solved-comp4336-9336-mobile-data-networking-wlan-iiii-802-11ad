Q1.




To cover all directions (360 degrees), an 802.11ad PCP/AP employs two 10-sector antennas. Each antenna sector covers 18 degrees. During a Beacon Time (BT), how many beacons the AP should transmit?




Q2.




Two 802.11ad devices, STA1 and STA2, want to beamform. STA1 has 4 different antenna sectors while STA2 has only 2. How many more training frames will have to be transmitted if Exhaustive Search is preferred over the Omni-direction search approach?




Q3.




In Example 4 (see lecture notes), the outcome of the SLS is the beam pair (3,1). For what range of RSS values recorded at the responder for the frame transmitted by the first antenna sector in A would lead to (1,1) as the SLS outcome?




Q4.




Four overlapping 802.11ad WLANs (PBSSs) formed a cluster to connect a large number of devices in an open space. The first beacon SP (beacon for S-PCP) is scheduled at time T0 while the 3<sup>rd</sup> is scheduled at T0+8ms. What was the original BI for a single PBSS?




Q5.




In Example 5 (see lecture notes), we have seen that if the pair (A,B) is communicating, the pair (E,F) cannot communicate without significant interference. Given the beamforming information available in the table, can the PCP/AP decide whether the pair (C,D) can communicate while (A,B) communication has been scheduled at the same time?
